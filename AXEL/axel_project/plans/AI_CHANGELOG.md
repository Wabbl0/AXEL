## 2026-05-06 - Create Persistent AI Docs System

- Request: Create persistent AI docs that unify plans, style/lore sources, exports (including moon princess files), engine logic context, and include a future implemented-changes changelog workflow.
- Implementation: Added canonical AI governance docs and rule wiring for always-on consistency across AXEL work.
- Files changed:
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/AI_DOCS.md`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/AI_CHANGELOG.md`
  - `.cursor/rules/axel-ai-docs-governance.mdc`
- Behavior impact: Future agent chats can consistently align with project canon and will append implemented changes to this changelog.
- Verification: Confirmed files created with cross-references and clear hierarchy/changelog procedure.
- Notes: Exported Moon Princess assets are documented as reference-only unless explicitly promoted.

## 2026-05-06 - Require Live Progress Feed

- Request: Add a persistent rule so chats expose live execution progress (what is running, checked/read, and whether stuck).
- Implementation: Updated AXEL governance rule and canonical AI docs workflow to require a live progress feed for long or multi-step tasks, including a fixed status checklist.
- Files changed:
  - `.cursor/rules/axel-ai-docs-governance.mdc`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/AI_DOCS.md`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/AI_CHANGELOG.md`
- Behavior impact: Future AXEL task chats should provide clearer runtime visibility and progress transparency during execution.
- Verification: Verified both governance documents now explicitly include the live progress feed requirement and status fields.
- Notes: No source-hierarchy conflict; requirement was added consistently to both always-on rule and canonical docs.

## 2026-05-06 - Reorganize commands, logs, and sprites

- Request: Move command scripts into their own folder, move debug logs into their own folder, and move `axel_project` sprites under `assets`.
- Implementation: Created dedicated `tools/cmd` and `logs/debug` folders, moved root `.cmd`/debug files there, updated affected script references, and moved sprite assets from `axel_project/sprites` to `axel_project/assets/sprites`.
- Files changed:
  - `tools/cmd/godot.cmd`
  - `logs/debug/debug-1d1bdd.log`
  - `logs/debug/debug-451875.log`
  - `logs/debug/debug-4ccea5.log`
  - `logs/debug/debug-7980eb.log`
  - `logs/debug/debug-c9d495.log`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/assets/sprites/mike_walking-Sheet.png`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/assets/sprites/mike_walking-Sheet.png.import`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/assets/sprites/mike_walking.aseprite`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/assets/sprites/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/scripts/Player.gd`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/scenes/Arc_1/1.1_SchoolExterior.tscn`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/combat/scripts/combat_root.gd`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/combat/scripts/free_spins.gd`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/combat/scripts/combat_test.gd`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/combat/scripts/line_detector.gd`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/ScriptReloadMarker.gd`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/exports/GameManager.gd`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/combat/VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/AI_CHANGELOG.md`
- Behavior impact: Project root is cleaner, command and debug artifacts are centralized, and sprite loading now resolves from `assets/sprites`.
- Verification: Verified file moves succeeded and updated code references now point to the new locations.
- Notes: No source-hierarchy conflict; change is a structural reorganization only.

## 2026-05-06 - Add AXEL structure taxonomy and scaffolding

- Request: Implement a stronger AXEL folder categorization pass with clearer long-term organization.
- Implementation: Added a canonical structure/naming guide and scaffolded category folders under assets/scenes/scripts/data/tools to reduce root clutter while keeping runtime paths stable.
- Files changed:
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/README_STRUCTURE.md`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/AXEL_notes.md`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/assets/textures/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/assets/audio/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/assets/ui/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/assets/fonts/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/assets/vfx/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/scenes/ui/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/scenes/core/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/scripts/core/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/scripts/gameplay/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/scripts/ui/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/data/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/tools/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/AI_CHANGELOG.md`
- Behavior impact: AXEL now has an explicit, documented taxonomy and ready-to-use categorized directories for future migrations without forcing risky runtime path rewrites in one step.
- Verification: Verified folder creation completed successfully; lints report no introduced errors in edited text/code files.
- Notes: No source-hierarchy conflict; this is a non-breaking foundational organization pass.

## 2026-05-07 - Remove OAF and PixelLab Pipeline Artifacts

- Request: Remove OAF-related command artifacts and remove `asset_input` / `asset_output` + PixelLab API tooling after subscription loss.
- Implementation: Deleted OAF command scripts from `tools/cmd/`, removed PixelLab restyling pipeline inputs/outputs and utility script, removed now-unused Python dependency file, and updated project docs/changelog references to match current state.
- Files changed:
  - `tools/cmd/agent_feed.cmd`
  - `tools/cmd/oaf.cmd`
  - `tools/cmd/oaf_status.cmd`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/asset_input/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/asset_output/.gitkeep`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/asset_output/.restyle_cache.json`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/tools/restyle_assets.py`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/__pycache__/restyle_assets.cpython-314.pyc`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/requirements.txt`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/README_STRUCTURE.md`
  - `AXEL/axel_project/plans/AI_CHANGELOG.md`
- Behavior impact: OAF terminal-focus workflow and PixelLab asset restyling workflow are fully removed from this repository state.
- Verification: Confirmed file deletions and re-scanned repository for `oaf`, `agent_feed`, `restyle_assets`, `asset_input`, `asset_output`, and `pixellab` references.
- Notes: Historical changelog text was adjusted per explicit user request to remove direct mentions of removed OAF/restyle files.
